## 🚀 Overview
This is a **personal project** aimed at mastering TypeScript for full-stack web development. It covers the fundamentals of TypeScript, advanced type features, and practical implementations in both frontend and backend development.

## 📌 Features
- TypeScript fundamentals and best practices
- Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript
- Frontend with **React** & **Next.js**
- Backend with **Node.js**, **Express**, & **NestJS**
- API development and type-safe database integration (Prisma, TypeORM)
- Full-stack architecture using TypeScript
- Error handling, testing, and deployment best practices

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, NestJS
